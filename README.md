Describe quantum computing in a simple, layman's terms:

Quantum computing is a new way to process information using quantum bits instead of classical bits. This enables quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than traditional computers.

A quantum bit is a unit of quantum information. It is the fundamental structure of a quantum computer.

A qubit is a unit of quantum information.

A qubit is a unit of quantum information that can store a fraction of a quantum state.

The fraction of a quantum state that a qubit can store is known as its "coherence."

Quantum coherence is the ability of a qubit to remain in a superposition of states

In quantum mechanics, a superposition of states is a combination of two or more quantum states. The total state of a system is the sum of the individual states.

An example of a superposition of states is when a qubit is in both the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states simultaneously.

A qubit can be visualized as a point on the surface of a sphere. The |0⟩ and |1⟩ states correspond to the north and south poles of the sphere, respectively.

Any other point on the sphere corresponds to a superposition of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.

A regular bit can store a maximum of 2^64, or two raised to the 64th power, or 4,294,967,296 different combinations. In contrast, a qubit can store a fraction of a quantum state, enabling it to hold a virtually unlimited amount of information.
